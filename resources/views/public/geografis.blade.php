        <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content thatâ€™s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-5">Blockquotes</h2>
        <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Example lists</h3>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body of text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First list item</li>
            <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
            <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First list item</li>
            <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
            <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>And this is a definition list:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</dt>
            <dd>The language used to describe and define the content of a Web page</dd>
            <dt>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</dt>
            <dd>Used to describe the appearance of Web content</dd>
            <dt>JavaScript (JS)</dt>
            <dd>The programming language used to build advanced Web sites and applications</dd>
